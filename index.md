## [Project Description](#project-description)

This research coordination network (RCN) will advance the standardization and adoption of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) for research facilities and instruments nationally. PIDs are widely seen as foundational to open science in that PIDs uniquely identify various entities in the research ecosystem. While many categories of PIDs have come a long way in terms of standardization and adoption (examples: DOIs for publications, ORCIDs for researchers), this project is focused on the need to advance the standardization and adoption of PIDs for other categories of entities in the research ecosystem which have not progressed as far, namely for research facilities and instruments. The scientific communities which this RCN will support include the biomedical sciences, the geosciences, informatics, and many or most other scientific fields which utilize specialized facilities and equipment in the research process.

While persistent identifiers are already being assigned to facilities and research equipment in a few limited cases, significantly more community adoption and standardization is needed to address the entire research ecosystem. This project builds on activities already being undertaken such as RRIDs (Research Resource Identifiers), and will convene a series of workshops and stakeholder engagements to better understand the field and current practice, develop principles of design for new PIDs, and work to generalize these principles toward practical application, thereby aiming to achieve tangible outcomes for open science.

Coming Soon

## [Advisory Committee](#advisory-committee)

### Anita Bandrowski

Anita is the founder and CEO of SciCrunch, a company devoted to improving reproducibility in science by working with publishers. Anita also founded the Resource Identification Initiative, which provides RRIDs for resources such as antibodies, model organisms, cell lines, plasmids, and research instruments.

### David S. Butcher

David is the FAIR data management specialist at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, managing the implementation of FAIR and open science practices across the MagLab’s diverse user facilities. He is also a faculty member of the MagLab’s Ion Cyclotron Resonance department, focusing on biological applications of mass spectrometry and top-down proteomics.

### Matthew Buys

Matthew Buys is the Executive Director of DataCite, an international organization that provides Digital Object Identifier (DOI) registration services. DataCite supports over 1,200 organizations from 50 countries, and supports the assignment of PIDs and metadata to a wide variety of research resources, including facilities and instruments.

### Danielle Cooper and Dylan Ruediger

Danielle and Dylan are from from Ithaka S+R, a not-for-profit research organization that specializes in leveraging cross-sector engagement with academic administration and leadership, scholarly communications, scholarly societies, libraries, and information technology services. Danielle is Associate Director, and Dylan is Senior Analyst; they are both experts on maximizing opportunities for researcher sharing to advance FAIR and open science principles, for example, in a current NSF-funded project on Leveraging Data Communities to Advance Open Science.

### Nate Herzog

Nate is the CoreMarketPlace project lead at Vermont Genetics Network. The CoreMarketplace (CM) is a searchable listing of active core facilities. The purpose of the Core Marketplace is to provide this directory of research facilities to the scientific community. It also furthers research by highlighting citable resources within a listing for
scientific publication. The Core Marketplace has listings from 225 institutions, 863 active facilities from 11 countries.

### Kevin Knudtson

Kevin is tbe current President of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF). ABRF is the leading membership organization of members working within or in support of resource and research biotechnology laboratories. Kevin is a member of the ABRF Core Facilities Rigor and Reproducibility Committee whose goal is to improve transparency of research through the use of PIDs.

### Giri Prakash

Giri is the Section Head of the Earth System Informatics and Data Discovery section at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He is responsible for overseeing data center groups that manage the earth and environmental data centers.

### Shelley Stall and Brooks Hanson

Shelley and Brooks are from the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Shelley is the Sr. Director for Data Leadership for AGU, and Brooks Hanson is the Executive Vice President for Science at AGU. Both Shelley and Brooks have been leaders in the Earth science publishing industry, and have been community organizers for data repositories and publishers to develop community conventions for the use of PIDs in scientific publications (Stall et al, 2019).
